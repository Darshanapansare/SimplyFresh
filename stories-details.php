                            <p>Neeraja Kudrimoti made a bold decision to leave behind a successful corporate career to
                                pursue a deeper calling in rural India. After working in a high-paying IT job in Pune,
                                Neeraja felt the urge to contribute more meaningfully to the country’s development,
                                especially in overlooked rural regions. She joined the Prime Minister’s Rural
                                Development Fellowship Scheme (PMRDFS) and worked in Naxal-affected Chhattisgarh, where
                                she quickly realised the pressing need for sustainable farming practices.</p>

                                                traditional farming. Seeing an opportunity to make a lasting impact, she

                                                introduce them to millet farming. Her goal was to help farmers move away
                                                from water-intensive crops, improving both the environment and their
